# Trading_Reinforcment_Learning

This project involves building a trading simulation where the portfolio consists of three stocks: Apple, Coca-Cola, and IBM. The portfolio is rebalanced weekly, and decisions are made based on the previous weekâ€™s returns and current holdings. The simulation runs from 2010 to 2017, terminating when the net portfolio value falls to zero or the year 2017 ends.
